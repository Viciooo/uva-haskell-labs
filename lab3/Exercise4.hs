{- R = {(x, y) | x â‰¡ y(mod n)}, n>0.
R is serial, because for every x, there will always be a y such that the mod
of n is the same for both. This is because the modulos represents the remainder
of a division, which is circular, i.e. between 1..n the value will go from 0..n-1
and once the number is >n, it will repeat the previous pattern, arrinving at 0
for every multiple of n. No more indications are given about the values x and y, then
we can assume that for every x in A, x is equal to its own module

How can you test whether R is serial? 
R can be tester if its serial by choosing a random positive integer for n,
on the list [1..n] such that each element has at least one

How can you prove that R is serial?
Given that neither x or y have any restrictions, for any domain A x mod n is always equal to
himself, i.e. for any domain A, R is reflexive. By definition of serial, if a set R is 
reflexive than is also serial.
