-- Exercise 6
-- Week 3’s lectures discusses the conversion of Boolean formulas (formulas of propositional logic) 
-- into CNF form. The lecture notes also give a definition of a Haskell datatype for formulas of 
-- Lab 1  Week 23. Pre/Post Conditions, Hoare Logic and Propositional Logic7propositional logic, using lists for conjunctions and disjunctions. Your task is to write a Haskell 
-- program for converting formulas into CNF.
-- Use the following declaration: 
-- cnf :: Form -> Form
-- Deliverables: conversion program with documentation, indication of time spent
