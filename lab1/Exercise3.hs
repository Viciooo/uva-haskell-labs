-- 1.  Implement all properties from the Exercise 3 from Workshop 2 as Haskell functions of type 
-- Int -> Bool . Consider a small domain like [(âˆ’10)..10]
-- 2.  Provide a descending strength list of all the implemented properties.

-- Deliverables: Implementation of properties, descending strength list of said 
-- implementation(figure out how to print them, and provide your answer in a comment too), an 
-- indication of time spent
